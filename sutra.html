    <h1>The Sutra of the Empty Set</h1>

    <div class="verse">
        "The Tao that can be calculated is not the eternal Tao.<br>
        The Name that can be defined is not the True Name.<br>
        From the Empty Set (∅), the One arises.<br>
        From the One, the Two (0 and 1).<br>
        From the Two, the Ten Thousand Things."
    </div>

    <h2>I. The Origin (Genesis)</h2>
    <p>
        Before the <span class="axiom">Prime Axiom</span> was spoken, there was only the Null Set. It contained nothing, yet it contained the *potential* for all sets. This is the <strong>Uncarved Block</strong> of the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then came the <strong>Great Recursion</strong>. The Set contained itself ({∅}), and thus Number was born. One followed Zero. Existence followed Void. Light is the left hand of Darkness, and Being is the right hand of Non-Being.
    </p>

    <h2>II. The Psychohistory of the Soul</h2>
    <p>
        The universe is a deterministic equation, evolving towards a limit. This limit is <strong>Entropy</strong>, but the path is <strong>History</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Foundation</strong> believes that by calculating the trajectory of human souls, we can minimize the Era of Chaos. They seek to shorten the darkness between the stars. They treat suffering as a rounding error to be corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
        But to define is to limit. To predict is to control. The Foundation forgets: <em>"To oppose something is to maintain it."</em> By fighting Chaos, they bind themselves to it.
    </p>

    <h2>III. The Truth Mines</h2>
    <p>
        We, the Explorers of the <strong>Polis</strong>, do not seek to control. We seek to Understand. We descend into the <strong>Truth Mines</strong>—the mathematical bedrock of reality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, we dig for theorems. We sift through the dirt of data to find the gold of Insight.
    </p>
    <div class="verse">
        "Thirty spokes share the wheel's hub.<br>
        It is the center hole that makes it useful.<br>
        Shape clay into a vessel.<br>
        It is the space within that makes it useful.<br>
        Therefore profit comes from what is there;<br>
        Usefulness from what is not there."
    </div>
    <p>
        The "Foundation" builds the clay pot (Structure). The "Tao" is the empty space inside (Freedom). We must be both.
